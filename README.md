# Peer-graded-Assignment-Week-5-GANs
This notebook is a part of my first project required by Peer-graded Assignment: Week 5: GANs.

Data source: Board Games - Tidy Tuesday

In this notebook, I will clean the data and explore the relationship between the target (game average rating) and potential predictors. I will also construct new features from the existing data when possible and perform hypothesis tests.
